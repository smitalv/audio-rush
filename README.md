## About

Audio Rush is an arcade game for iOS. It was available on the App Store until September 2020. 

The goal is to slide your finger across the screen to avoid as many moving obstacles as possible. The game can be played using only sounds. The focus on accessibility makes it suitable for VoiceOver users.

## Installation

Apple (as of November 2023) does not provide an easy way to install apps that are not in the App Store. You will need a Mac OS device and Xcode. Here is a [tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/wiki/how-to-sideload).
